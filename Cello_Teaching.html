            I have taught cellists of all ages and believe anyone at any age is
            capable of learning the cello. As a teacher, I adjust every lesson
            to fit each studentâ€™s needs at the time. Lessons are fun and
            challenging. I offer 30-minute, 45-minute, and one hour lessons,
            both over the internet and face-to-face. I will often pair younger
            students with a method book and other supplementary materials. More
            advanced students may choose to focus on specific repertoire.
          </p>
          <p class="celloTeaching">
            I encourage my students to spearhead their learning and to be
            inquisitive problem-solvers. My students will not only strive for
            technical mastery of the instrument, but also to craft their own
            musical voice. In addition, I utilize many Alexander Technique
            principles in my cello teaching. My students should not only be
            wonderful cellists, but also be able to play with freedom and
            without pain. I also teach music theory, ear training, and
            improvisation. At whatever age or skill level, my students will come
            away with a passion for the cello and classical music.
