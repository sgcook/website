        <h3 class="aboutHeadAT">What is the Alexander Technique?</h3>
        <p class="aboutAT">
          The Alexander Technique (AT) gives us the ability to make choices that
          often we do not think are available to us. Are there certain tasks
          that you find you have to complete in a certain way? Do you ever get
          stuck in particular thoughts or emotions? What if you tried thinking
          or doing it differently? In essence, we are questioning our habits
          that we have instilled in us, often unconsciously. For many people
          unfamiliar with AT, they only see physical changes in a person’s body
          after AT. While it is tempting to separate ourselves and say we have
          “physical habits” and “mental habits,” you are your whole self. Our
          use of our bodies and our minds are interconnected. Through curiosity
          and compassion, we can heighten our awareness of ourselves and our
          relationship with our environment.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutHeadAT">Who is the Alexander Technique for?</h3>
        <p class="aboutAT">
          I believe everyone can benefit from AT. Performing artists and people
          with chronic pain have often utilized the technique. Artists and
          athletes use AT to combat performance anxiety, improve their practice,
          and increase their awareness of their bodies. Research has shown that
          AT has helped people with Parkinson’s. Some of my students have had
          club feet, scoliosis, and connective tissue disorders. AT has helped
          them to manage their daily pain and to improve mobility. I have used
          AT in my cello practicing and teaching, as well as in daily life when
          walking, sleeping, and cooking.
        </p>
        <h3 class="aboutHeadAT">What happens in an AT lesson?</h3>
        <p class="aboutAT">
          I strive to create an open and safe environment where my students can
          explore the technique without any judgement or fear. There is no right
          or wrong, only curiosity and a desire to learn. Students may come in
          with pain or a specific issue they want to resolve. In a first lesson,
          I will often tell F.M. Alexander’s journey of discovering the
          technique and teach the concept of inhibition.

          “I came to Sara looking to find a way to keep on practicing and
          enjoying my music without having any pain. After several weeks of
          exploring Alexander Technique with Sara, we came up with a fantastic
          solution. Sara is extremely helpful and kind and is willing to work on

          Sara's teaching style is calm and grounded, yet engaging and
          challenging. She knows when to push and when to pull back. Sara is
          receptive and adapts to the type of activity that works best for me. -
