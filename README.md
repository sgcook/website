# Personal Cello Website

My personal website as a cellist, cello teacher, and Alexander Technique teacher.

This was my first coding project.
I learned the basics of CSS, HTML, and limited Javascript.
I also learned about media queries and how to deploy a website using Netlify.

## Built using:
  * CSS
  * HTML
  * Javascript
